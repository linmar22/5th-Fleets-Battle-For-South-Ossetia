# 5th-Fleets-Battle-For-South-Ossetia

## About
Battle for South Ossetia is designed to be a persistant server map containing the ability for players to a variety of air missions for
quick and dynamic play.  Conflict area is based around the Russo-Georgian War and available aircraft are based on real-world squadrons
and ground forces, HOWEVER the mission itself is fictional.

## Features
- Air and Ground forces based on real life squadrons and units.
- Static military sites (including SAMs) based on real-world locations
- Custom created strategic targets based on real-world sites.
- Spawnable Air missions including CAS, BAI, and Interdiction.
- AI-controlled CAP spawning and patroling.

## Installation
1) Open the /build directory
2) Copy 5thFleetBSouthOssetia.miz file to C:\Users\USERNAME\Saved Games\DCS\Missions
3) Mission will appear in DCS under 'My Missions'

## Spawning Missions
Battle for South Ossetia allows clients to generate various missions for their coalition.  The mission units and their locations are randomized, but also are comprised of real groupings and located in an area that makes sense (A CAS mission won't occur 100 miles behind the conflict area).  The current missions available are CAS, BAI/Strike, Intercept and Escort.

### CAS Missions
CAS Missions are comprised of an enemy group of ground forces, with a friendly group located nearby, and a JTAC.  Using the radio menu, clients can have the target marked by laser, smoke, or illumination.  JTAC is controlled using MOOSE's DESIGNATE function.  Friendly ground targets can also be controlled via Combined Arms, allowing for coordinated air/ground attacks on enemy units.

## Future Plans
